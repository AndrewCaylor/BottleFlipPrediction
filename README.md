# BottleFlipPrediction

My final physics project in highschool!

Determines if a water bottle flip will land right-side-up.

Uses OpenCV to detect initial angle and angular velocoty of a water bottle.
Does center of mass and moment of intertia sinulations on an ideal water bottle to determine the final angle of the bottle upon landing.
